# MoniCode Studios

## About us, well me
I, [Monika Eve C.](https://github.com/crooked-smile), am a want-to-be game devloper. 
I made the MoniCode Studios orgnization so I could give credit to my friends and classmates who helped with the various games and projects shown on here. 

Take my current school project, [Element Idle](https://github.com/MoniCode-Studios/element-idle), this I worked on with my friends.

With that being said, I hope that the games and products we/I make are enjoyed by you all.
May you enjoy your day/night :3
